This is my fourth project - Link.

In addition to using the HTML and CSS I learned last semester, I also used JavaScript to link an Are.na channel and create web pages. My topic is "Error as Aesthetic," inspired by the pixel distortions that appear on computer screens due to errors. Since computer malfunctions often result in abnormal pixel formations, I incorporated this visual language into my design. To enhance differentiation, I assigned a unique color to each file category.
